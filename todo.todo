Additional Portfolio Attributes:
    - Max spend: Max amount to spend on a single trade per symbol. Eg if AAPL Cash is 2000 & Max spend is .75, then max spend is 1500 on trades
    - Quantity factor: When filtering for orders, we use a max close price to determine the order. If quantity factor is 4, that means we'd want to buy 4 contracts/spreads. Therefore, max close is available trading cash divided by 4.
